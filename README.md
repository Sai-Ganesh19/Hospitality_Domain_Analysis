Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands, a luxury and business hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to intensified competition and suboptimal management decisions. To regain its competitive edge, the management decided to leverage business and data intelligence for strategic decision-making. However, without an in-house analytics team, they engaged a third-party data analytics provider to extract actionable insights from historical booking, revenue, and customer experience data.

The challenge was to analyze three months of operational and booking data from multiple hotels, identify key performance trends, and create an interactive dashboard that would help the revenue management team make informed, data-driven decisions.

Project Description
This project involved designing and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide revenue insights for AtliQ Grands' executive and revenue management teams. Using data from five structured datasets (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings), the dashboard integrates multiple performance metrics such as:

Revenue KPIs: Total revenue, ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), and week-on-week growth trends.

Occupancy & Utilization Metrics: Occupancy %, DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights), DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights).

Booking Behavior Analysis: Cancellation %, No-show rates, Realisation %, booking distribution by platform, city, room class, and day type.

Customer Experience: Average ratings by city, property, and week.

Key features of the dashboard:

Time-based filtering: Ability to drill down by month, week, or specific date range.

Category segmentation: Compare performance between luxury and business hotel categories.

City & Property-level analysis: Identify top-performing and underperforming properties.

Booking channel analysis: Understand customer booking preferences (online, offline, OTA platforms).

Interactive visualizations: Revenue trends, occupancy comparisons, and platform-wise realization analysis.

Impact:
The dashboard enables AtliQ Grandsâ€™ leadership to monitor revenue patterns, identify underperforming segments, and optimize pricing, marketing, and operational strategies based on real-time business intelligence.
